1. How to convert a local folder into git repository
Go to the folder you want to initialize as git repo
run "git init"
this will create .git hidden folder in the same directory
run "git status"
this will show all the list of files that are not committed yet.
first run "git add * to add all the files into git tracking list.
then, when you run git commit, it will ask you to configure your github account email and name, set these two in your command prompt.
 git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
